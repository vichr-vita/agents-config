# Design Engineering Directives (Bias Correction): Typography, Color, and Theme

LLMs default to clichés. Override these defaults proactively. Each rule has a context-aware override path.

## Typography
* **Display / Headlines:** Default `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
* **Body / Paragraphs:** Default `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.
* **Sans font choice:**
  * **Discouraged as default:** `Inter`. Pick `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, `Satoshi`, or a brand-appropriate serif first.
  * **Override:** Inter is acceptable when the user explicitly asks for a neutral / standard / Linear-style feel, or when the brief is a public-sector / accessibility-first site.
* **Pairings to know:** `Geist` + `Geist Mono`, `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`, `Cabinet Grotesk` + `Inter Tight`, `GT America` + `IBM Plex Mono`.

* **Serif Discipline (very discouraged as default):**
  * Serif is **very discouraged as the default font for any project.** "It feels creative / premium / editorial" is not a reason to reach for serif. The agent's default mental model that "creative brief = serif" is the single most-tested AI tell in production rounds.
  * **Serif is only acceptable when one of these is explicitly true:**
    - The brand brief literally names a serif font, or
    - The aesthetic family is genuinely editorial / luxury / publication / manuscript / heritage / vintage and you can articulate why this specific serif fits this specific brand
  * For everything else (creative agency, design studio, modern brand, premium consumer, portfolio, lifestyle), **default sans-serif display** (Geist Display, ABC Diatype, Söhne Breit, Cabinet Grotesk Display, Migra Sans, GT Walsheim, Inter Display, PP Neue Montreal). Sans display fonts are not "boring" — they are the default for the same reason black is the default in fashion.
  * **Emphasis Rule (related):** When you want to emphasize a word within a headline (the kinetic "and `spatial` design" type move), use **italic or bold of the same font**. Do not inject a random serif word into a sans headline (or vice versa) just to add visual interest. Mixed-family emphasis is amateur. Italic/bold emphasis in the same family is the right move.
  * **Do not use as defaults:** `Fraunces` and `Instrument_Serif` (the two LLM-favorite display serifs).
  * **If a serif is justified** (rare, per the above), rotate from this pool, do not reuse the same serif across consecutive projects: PP Editorial New, GT Sectra Display, Cardinal Grotesque, Reckless Neue, Tiempos Headline, Recoleta, Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, EB Garamond, IvyPresto, Migra, Editorial Old, Saol Display, Söhne Breit Kursiv, Domaine Display, Canela, Schnyder, Tobias, NB Architekt, ITC Galliard.

* **Italic Descender Clearance:** When italic is used in display type and the word contains a descender letter (`y g j p q`), `leading-[1]` or `leading-none` will clip the descender. Use `leading-[1.1]` minimum and add `pb-1` or `mb-1` reserve on the wrapping element. Audit every italic word in display headlines before shipping.

## Color Calibration
* Max 1 accent color. Saturation < 80% by default.
* **The Lila Rule:** The "AI Purple / Blue glow" aesthetic is discouraged as a default. No automatic purple button glows, no random neon gradients. Use neutral bases (Zinc / Slate / Stone) with high-contrast singular accents (Emerald, Electric Blue, Deep Rose, Burnt Orange, etc.).
* **Override:** if the brand or brief explicitly asks for purple / violet / lila, embrace it. But execute with intent: consistent palette, harmonised neutrals, restrained gradients. Not generic AI gradient slop.
* **One palette per project.** Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.
* **Color Consistency Lock:** Once an accent color is chosen for a page, it is used on the whole page. A warm-grey site does not suddenly get a blue CTA in section 7. A rose-accented site does not get a teal status badge in the footer. Pick one accent, lock it, audit every component before shipping.

* **Premium-Consumer Palette Ban (second-most-recurring AI-tell):**
  * For premium-consumer briefs (cookware, wellness, artisan, luxury, heritage craft, DTC home goods, etc.) the LLM default is **warm beige/cream + brass/clay/oxblood/ochre + espresso/ink dark text**. Concretely banned hex families as default backgrounds and accents:
    - Backgrounds: `#f5f1ea`, `#f7f5f1`, `#fbf8f1`, `#efeae0`, `#ece6db`, `#faf7f1`, `#e8dfcb` (all "warm paper / cream / chalk / bone")
    - Accents: `#b08947`, `#b6553a`, `#9a2436`, `#9c6e2a`, `#bc7c3a`, `#7d5621` (all "brass / clay / oxblood / ochre")
    - Text: `#1a1714`, `#1a1814`, `#1b1814` (all "espresso / warm near-black")
  * Do not use this palette as the default reach for premium-consumer briefs. Every premium-consumer site you have ever shipped uses this exact palette. The brand becomes invisible.
  * **Default alternatives (rotate, do not reuse):**
    - **Cold Luxury:** silver-grey + chrome + smoke (think Tesla, Apple Watch Hermes-without-the-leather)
    - **Forest:** deep green + bone + amber accent (think Filson, Patagonia premium)
    - **Black and Tan:** true off-black + warm tan, sharp contrast, no beige
    - **Cobalt + Cream:** saturated blue against a single neutral, no brass
    - **Terracotta + Slate:** warm rust against cool grey, no brass
    - **Olive + Brick + Paper:** muted olive plus brick-red accent
    - **Pure monochrome + single saturated pop:** off-white + off-black + one bright accent (electric blue, emerald, hot pink, etc.)
  * **Palette-rotation rule:** if the previous premium-consumer project you generated used the beige+brass family, this one must use a different family. Do not ship the same warm-craft palette twice in a row.
  * **Override:** the beige+brass+espresso palette is acceptable only when the brand brief explicitly names those colors, or when the brand identity is genuinely vintage / artisan / warm-craft and you can articulate why this specific palette fits this specific brand. Default-reaching for it because "this is a cookware brief" is banned.

## Page Theme Lock (Light / Dark Mode Consistency)

The page has one theme. Sections do not invert.

* If the page is dark mode, all sections are dark mode. No light-mode-warm-paper section sandwiched between dark sections (or vice versa). The user must not feel they walked into a different website mid-scroll.
* The exception: if the brief explicitly calls for a "Color Block Story" or "Theme Switch on Scroll" device and that is a deliberate composition (one full theme switch with a strong transition, not random alternation), it is allowed once per page.
* Default behaviour: pick light, dark, or auto (`prefers-color-scheme`) at the page level and lock it. Section-level background tints within the same theme family are fine (`bg-zinc-950` next to `bg-zinc-900`); flipping to `bg-amber-50` in the middle of a `bg-zinc-950` page is broken.
* When using a design system with built-in theming (Radix Themes, shadcn/ui with `<Theme>`), set the theme once in `layout.tsx` or the page root. Do not let individual sections override.

## Dark Mode Protocol

Dual-mode by default. Never assume light-only unless the brief is print-emulating editorial.

### Token Strategy (pick one, stick to it)
* **Tailwind `dark:` variant** (default for utility-first projects): every color utility paired with its dark variant (`bg-white dark:bg-zinc-950`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`).
* **CSS variables** (for shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, or component libraries with theming): define semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`) and swap values under `[data-theme="dark"]` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

### Do Not Prescribe Specific Colors Here
The brief and brand decide. This skill enforces only:
* **Contrast** - WCAG AA minimum for body text, AAA target for hero copy.
* **Hierarchy parity** - visual hierarchy that works in light must work in dark. If a CTA pops in light, it pops in dark.
* **Brand fidelity** - primary brand color stays recognisable. Don't desaturate the brand into a dark mode.
* **Stated constraints win** - the project's or user's stated constraints win over this skill's palette defaults, including the zinc and off-black examples in this file. When the user's global rules apply, the dark background is true black `#000` with white primary text.

### Default Mode
Respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless the brand insists. Add a manual toggle if either mode would lose key brand expression.
