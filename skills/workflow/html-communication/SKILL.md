# HTML communication

## When to use

Use this skill for any request to produce a readable HTML artifact for a human, whether it is called a plan, a spec, a write-up, findings, a summary, a report, a comparison, or a set of UI mocks. The word "plan" is often absent. What the requests share is a document to read outside the terminal, and a link to open it.

Also use it whenever a user supplies a `postplan.dev` URL to read.

Do **not** use it for HTML that is part of the product being built (app templates, components, marketing pages). This skill is for documents about work, not shipped UI.

## Read a Postplan URL

When a user supplies a `postplan.dev` URL, fetch the uploaded HTML immediately with the shell. Do not use web search or a browser to retrieve it.

1. Remove a trailing slash, then append `/raw` unless the URL already ends in `/raw`.
2. Run `curl --fail --silent --show-error --location --max-time 30 --output /tmp/postplan.html '<raw-url>'`.
3. Read `/tmp/postplan.html` as the user's artifact and continue the requested task.

A web-search refusal is not evidence that Postplan rejected the request. If `curl` fails, report its actual status or network error; do not substitute search results.

## Document

Create one self-contained HTML file, capped at 512 KB.

- Write it like a spec, not a landing page: dense, scannable, no hero, decorative chrome, marketing voice, or em dashes.
- Default to true black (`#000`), white primary text, and dark gray only for secondary surfaces or accents.
- Make it mobile-readable with a responsive viewport and no fixed-width layout.
- Use semantic HTML, inline CSS, inline SVG, and HTTPS or data-URL images.
- Use an inline classic script only when interactivity materially helps. Keep scripted pages useful without JavaScript; the sandbox blocks storage, fetch, workers, frames, forms, and popups.
- In script-free files, give external links `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. If any script exists, omit `target="_blank"`.

Never include external or module scripts, inline event handlers, `javascript:` URLs, forms, frames, embeds, objects, applets, meta refresh, linked stylesheets, secrets, private URLs, or local filesystem paths.

## UI mocks

When the user asks for variants:

- Render real styled variants, not descriptions.
- Label them `A`, `B`, `C`... for easy selection.
- Lay them out for direct comparison.
- Keep one file across iterations so its Postplan URL stays stable.

## Publish

Vít has given standing permission to upload every artifact created or updated with this skill. Upload is required, including in Auto mode. Do not ask for separate permission or stop at the local file.

1. Write the HTML file locally.
2. Run `npx postplan upload <file path>`.
3. Report the local path and returned Postplan URL.

Re-upload the same absolute path to update the existing URL. Use `npx postplan upload <file path> --new` only when a new draft is wanted.

If validation fails, fix the markup and retry. If a scripted upload needs authentication, ask the user to run `postplan auth login`, then retry without removing the requested interactivity.

Never open a browser or claim the document is hosted before upload succeeds. Do not verify in a browser unless the user asks.
